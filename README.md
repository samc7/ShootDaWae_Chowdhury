Shoot Da Wae Thru Space (2018)
==
This is my Grade 10 Computer Science Course Culminating Game. The game is a rendition of Space Shooter. This is my first video game, as well as my first time using Object Oriented Programming.

## The Original Proposal
SDWTS is an Endurance game requiring repetition of game skills. It tests gamersâ€™ reflexes and how long the gamer can continue to survive and Shoot Their Way Thru Space. It is important to test endurance as another skill because it is a critical gaming skill that is often overlooked. SDWTS aims to revive an old game (Space Shooter), solve the problem of the lack of endurance games and include a simple game for gamers to play and enjoy during a coffee break.
