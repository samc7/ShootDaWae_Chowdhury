Shoot Da Wae Thru Space (2018)
==
This is my Grade 10 Computer Science Course Culminating Game. The game is a rendition of Space Shooter. This is my first video game, as well as my first time using Object Oriented Programming. There are a few minor bugs.

## The Original Proposal
SDWTS is an Endurance game requiring repetition of game skills. It tests gamersâ€™ reflexes and how long the gamer can continue to survive and Shoot Their Way Thru Space. It is important to test endurance as another skill because it is a critical gaming skill that is often overlooked. SDWTS aims to revive an old game (Space Shooter), solve the problem of the lack of endurance games and include a simple game for gamers to play and enjoy during a coffee break.

## The Story
You have been assigned to carry precious bounty accrss he Universe eternally. Defen the bounty (and yourself) from aliens who are trying
to take your bounty! Every three alien ships killed, the faster and stronger the aliens become.
